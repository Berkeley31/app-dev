> #### How to get away with Murder
> The series is all about a group of students under the guidance of a Law Professor named Annalise Keating. The students are thought of how the law system works and how it can be taken advantage which shows how loose and unfair the justice system really is.
> 
> The reason that I really love this series is that I always have keen interest about how the law and order actually works. Like how the legal system can affect the life of a person and how twisted it can be to be able to make the innocent a criminal and a criminal to be innocent. It can also be related even to our own justice system and politics that allows people of evil doers to be part of the government.

> #### Sherlock
> It is inspired from the famous fictional character Sherlock Holmes.
>
> I always have a special interest in watching detective stories especially when it comes to sherlock holmes. I used to read a story entitled Project Loki which is also similar to the story of sherlock holmes which I later learned that it was actually inspired from it. Ever since, reading stuff about deducting stuff in a logical manner is cool for me, which also affected personality and made me somehow a logical type of thinker.

> #### Sex Education
> It is a series that tackles about the identity crisis and curiosity of teenagers about sexuality as a whole.
>
> When I first watched this series way back 2019 in its first season, I was a highschool student that doesn't have a wide mindset and understanding about the word "sexuality" or "sex", even the idea like same sex relationship and having gay or lesbian friends was not something I could really understand. This series opened my eyes about many things that talks about relationships and LGBTQ stuff. I can also say that it is also a factor that helped me to become more mature and allow myself to be more understanding and open about other people.
